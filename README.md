# ML_code
This is the final code of the machine learning model from the dataset found from Kaggle.

The main objective is to extract data from a csv file and getting a logistic pattern out of it in order to predict a result. The csv file will contain vital data of normal people and patients such as SpO2, heartbeat rate and temperature from which the states of people they may have such as no symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms and serious symptoms will also be given. From this dataset of states with vital data, the Machine Learning (ML) model can be trained. After successful training of the ML model, it can predict after getting an input of vital data of new people whose data may or may not match with the dataset present in the csv file and tell them whether they need to take the Covid-19 test or not.

In the ML model, decision tree classifier algorithm is used due to it being a categorical problem.
